`VError` is a library in Node.js that extends the native `Error` object to provide several benefits when working with errors, especially in a nested or hierarchical error handling scenario. Here are some of the key benefits:

1. **Chaining of Errors:** 
   `VError` allows you to wrap errors, creating a chain of errors. This can be helpful in understanding the cause and effect relationship between different layers of errors in your application.

2. **Preservation of Error Metadata:**
   With `VError`, you can attach additional metadata to your errors which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

3. **Custom Error Types:**
   `VError` allows for the creation of custom error types which can be useful for creating domain-specific errors in your application.

4. **Enhanced Formatting and Messages:**
   It provides enhanced error message formatting capabilities, which can be useful for creating more descriptive error messages.

5. **Multi-error Handling:**
   With the `MultiError` class in the `VError` library, you can group multiple errors into a single error object. This can be useful when you have operations that produce multiple errors but you want to treat them as a single error event.

6. **Backtrace and Cause Analysis:**
   By wrapping errors, you can maintain a chain of causality that can be inspected later to understand the sequence of events that led to an error.

7. **Consistent Error Handling:**
   Utilizing `VError` can help in enforcing a consistent error handling strategy across your codebase.

Utilizing `VError` via the `createAndThrowVError` function can be beneficial for understanding the root causes of errors, especially when errors are generated in different layers of a application. This can be particularly useful in complex systems where tracing the origin of an error through multiple layers of code is a common requirement for debugging and error resolution.
